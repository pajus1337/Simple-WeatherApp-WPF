  Applause as well as the original idea should be given to Jannick Laismann,                            
  he as my temporary "docent" taught me the techniques for creating this application.

More description about the development of the project and its future :
There will be 2 versions of this application, one in a simple and very clear version that will allow 
you to quickly understand, the logical mechanism of the API, as well as all the backEnd code 
development and frontEnd development in WPF applications.
Development of this version will be discontinued and will not be carried out in the future

The second version of the application will be further developed, to the development of which 
you can join if you want, as well as serve me in the further development of my skills. 
Based in this case on the development of front and back /-end code
